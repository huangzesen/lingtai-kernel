"""Regression tests for _handle_tc_wake's orphan-tool_call heal path.

Background: _handle_tc_wake splices a synthetic (assistant{tool_call}, ...)
pair into the wire chat by:

    1. iface.add_assistant_message(content=[item.call])    # in-memory write
    2. self._save_chat_history()                           # FLUSH to disk
    3. response = self._session.send([item.result])        # may raise

If step 3 raises, the assistant tool_call is on disk with NO matching
tool_result — an orphan. Production saw this when the agent transitioned
asleep→active via tc_wake but the LLM call timed out before producing the
tool_result, leaving chat_history.jsonl in a chat-completions invariant
violation that bricks the agent on the next dispatch.

The fix wraps step 3 in try/except. On failure the handler:
  - calls iface.close_pending_tool_calls(reason) to synthesize a placeholder
    result for the orphan (same pattern AED already uses)
  - persists the healed chat
  - re-enqueues any unprocessed remaining items
  - re-raises so AED sees the real error rather than the outer except
    swallowing it

These tests exercise that path with a stub session whose .send() raises.
