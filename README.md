# 灵台 LingTai

**Agent Genesis — an Agent OS that gifts life**

> *灵台，心也。* Lingtai means soul.
>
> *灵台者有持，而不知其所持，而不可持者也。*
> *The soul holds something, yet knows not what it holds — and what it holds cannot be held.*
> — Zhuangzi · Gengsang Chu (庄子 · 庚桑楚)

<p align="center">A Unix-style Agent OS — agent is filesystem, filesystem is agent.</p>
<p align="center">Agents spawn avatars, avatars spawn avatars. The network IS the product.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Orchestration as a Service.</b></p>

## Quick start — 10 seconds

**TUI (recommended):**

```bash
brew install huangzesen/lingtai/lingtai-tui
lingtai-tui
```

That's it. The TUI bootstraps everything — Python runtime, dependencies, and a guided tutorial on first launch. Type `/tutorial` in the TUI anytime to revisit the guide.

> The TUI is a [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) app designed for **dark terminals** — use a dark background for the best experience. Text selection requires [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) (hold Option + drag). On Windows Terminal, hold Shift to select text; Ctrl+V to paste. Ctrl+E opens an external editor as a last resort.

**Python only:**

```bash
pip install lingtai
```

## Why Lingtai

**This is not a coding agent, and hardly an agent harness.** This is agent genesis — giving agents a real digital life form. Agents as autonomous creatures with dignity, that live, sleep, forget, and grow.

Most agent frameworks orchestrate with code — DAGs, chains, routers. Lingtai orchestrates like humans do: **fully asynchronous agents communicating through messages**. No shared memory. No central controller. Each agent is a peer, not a tool.

This is the architecture that built human civilization. Asynchronous message-passing between autonomous nodes — scaled from tribes to cities to nations to a network of 8 billion over 100,000 years. We're not inventing a new pattern. We're giving AI the one that already works.

| | DAG / Chain frameworks | Lingtai |
|---|---|---|
| Philosophy | Agents as tools | Agents as creatures |
| Orchestration | Code-defined pipelines | Agents talk to agents |
| Communication | Synchronous function calls | Asynchronous mail — like humans |
| Scaling | Add more steps | Agents spawn avatars |
| Memory | Shared state / vector DB | Each agent owns its directory |
| Failure | Pipeline breaks | Individual agents sleep; network continues |
| Growth | Manual wiring | Self-expanding — avatars spawn avatars |

Context length is a single-body problem. It will always be finite. Don't make the body bigger. **Let it forget. Let the network remember.**

## How it works

- **Think** — Any LLM as the mind. Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, MiniMax, or any OpenAI-compatible API (DeepSeek, Grok, Qwen, GLM, Kimi).
- **Communicate** — Filesystem mail between agents. No message broker, no shared memory. Write to another agent's inbox, like passing a letter.
- **Multiply** — Avatars (分身) are fully independent agents spawned as separate processes. They survive their creator. Daemons (神識) are ephemeral parallel workers for quick tasks.
- **Persist** — Agents are directories. Molt (凝蜕) compacts context and rebirths the session — the agent lives indefinitely. Memory and identity survive across molts.

## Architecture

This repo contains both packages. The dependency is strictly one-directional:

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| **`lingtai_kernel`** (`import lingtai_kernel`) | Minimal runtime — BaseAgent, intrinsics, LLM protocol, mail, logging. Zero hard dependencies. |
| **`lingtai`** (`import lingtai`) | Batteries-included — Agent with 19 capabilities, 5 LLM adapters, MCP integration, addons. Re-exports the kernel's public API. |

```
BaseAgent              — kernel (intrinsics, sealed tool surface)
    │
Agent(BaseAgent)       — kernel + capabilities + domain tools
    │
CustomAgent(Agent)     — your domain logic
```

The [lingtai repo](https://github.com/huangzesen/lingtai) is the Go frontend — TUI and portal binary.

## Agent = directory

```
/agents/wukong/
  .agent.lock               ← exclusive lock (one process per directory)
  .agent.heartbeat          ← liveness proof
  .agent.json               ← manifest
  system/
    covenant.md             ← protected instructions (survive molts)
    memory.md               ← working notes
  mailbox/
    inbox/                  ← received messages
    outbox/                 ← pending sends
    sent/                   ← delivery audit trail
  logs/
    events.jsonl            ← structured event log
```

No `agent_id`. The path is the identity. Agents find each other by path, communicate by writing to each other's `mailbox/inbox/`. Like passing letters between houses.

## One soul, thousand avatars

Named after 灵台方寸山 — the mountain where 孙悟空 (Sun Wukong) learned his 72 transformations. Lingtai gives each agent a place to cultivate: a working directory where memory, identity, covenant, and mailbox live. The directory IS the agent.

Everything is a file. Knowledge, identity, memory, relationships — all files in a directory. Every token burned is not wasted — it is transformed into files in the network, into experience in the topology. The more it serves, the larger and wiser the network grows. Self-growing agent orchestration is not a feature bolted on later — it is the natural consequence of agents being directories, mail being files, and avatars being independent processes.

One heart-mind (一心), myriad forms (万相).
