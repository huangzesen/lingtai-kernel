"""OpenRouter adapter — first-class provider wrapping their OpenAI-compat API.

OpenRouter is an OpenAI-compatible gateway to many upstream model providers
(Anthropic, DeepSeek, GLM/Zhipu, Qwen, MiniMax, Kimi, ...). On the wire it
speaks OpenAI's /chat/completions format, so this adapter inherits
``OpenAIAdapter`` and only overrides what's OpenRouter-specific:

- Fixed base_url — no user configuration needed.
- Explicitly asks OpenRouter NOT to include reasoning text in responses
  (``reasoning: {include: false}``). Reasoning tokens are billed either
  way; the text is not useful to us, so we save the bytes. Flip
  ``include`` to True if you want the reasoning text exposed via
  ``LLMResponse.thoughts`` (for logs or side channels) — the OpenAI
  response parser already reads both ``reasoning_content`` and
  ``reasoning`` field names.
