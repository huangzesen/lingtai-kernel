  Operational guide for the `daemon` tool — how to inspect, debug, and reason
  about emanations (the agent fragments you spawn for parallel sub-tasks).

  Reach for this manual when:
    - You called `daemon(action="emanate", ...)` and the emanation has been
      running long enough that you want to know if it's stuck, slow, or
      working — without killing it on a hunch.
    - An emanation finished with `state=failed` or `state=timeout` and you
      need to figure out why.
    - You want to inspect on-disk artifacts of a past emanation (chat
      transcript, token spend, event log) — the folders persist forever and
      `daemon(action="list")` only shows currently-active runs.
    - You're trying to understand why your token totals don't match the sum
      of what your tools claim — daemon spend is tagged into your parent
      ledger and may explain the gap.

  This manual covers: the on-disk folder layout under `daemons/em-N-*/`,
  exactly which fields in `daemon.json` answer "is it stuck?" vs "is it
  thinking?", how to tail `chat_history.jsonl` to see latest progress,
  where token attribution lives, how `reclaim` interacts with persistence,
  and a worked example of inspecting a 5-minute-running emanation.

  Does NOT cover: the daemon tool's argument schema (in the tool description
  itself) or the cross-process recovery / orphan-detection mechanics
  (those need separate spec work).

  Companion: `lingtai-anatomy reference/runtime-loop.md` covers the broader
  agent runtime that emanations are mini-versions of. Read that first if
  you don't yet understand the turn loop, then come here for daemon-specific
  inspection patterns.

# daemon manual

The `daemon` tool's schema description covers the happy path. This manual is the deeper reference: how to inspect a slow or failed emanation, the on-disk artifact layout, and worked examples.

## Each emanation is a forensic mini-avatar

Every time you call `daemon(action="emanate", tasks=[...])`, each task gets a working folder under `daemons/` in your own directory. The folder is named:

    daemons/em-<N>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<6 hex>/

where `em-<N>` is the in-context handle (e.g. `em-3`). The handle resets to `em-1` after `reclaim`, but the timestamp+hash means historical folders never collide. **Folders persist forever** — `reclaim` only stops processes, not files. They're cleaned up incidentally when you molt (which wipes the working directory).

This means: when an emanation looks stuck, you can read its actual state instead of guessing. Don't kill it on a hunch — inspect first.

## Folder layout

```

## Inspection patterns

### "Is this emanation actually doing anything?"

Read `daemon.json` once. The fields you want:

- `state` — `running` / `done` / `failed` / `cancelled` / `timeout`
- `current_tool` — `"read"` / `"bash"` / null. If null while `state=running`, the emanation is waiting on the LLM. If non-null, it's executing that tool.
- `turn` — which LLM round the emanation is on
- `tool_call_count` — how many tool dispatches it has done
- `tokens` — running totals
- `elapsed_s` — wall clock since start

If `current_tool` is null AND `tool_call_count` hasn't changed for a while, the LLM is thinking — wait. If `current_tool` is set and stays set, that tool is slow (e.g., a big file read or a long bash command).

### "What has it figured out so far?"

Tail `history/chat_history.jsonl`. Each line is one role/turn entry:

- `{role: "user", kind: "task"}` — the original task
- `{role: "assistant", text: "..."}` — what the emanation said
- `{role: "user", kind: "tool_results"}` — what the tools returned
- `{role: "user", kind: "followup"}` — your `daemon(action="ask", ...)` messages

Read the most recent assistant text to see the latest progress narrative.

### "What did it spend?"

Either of:
- `daemon.json` field `tokens` — running totals across the whole run
- `logs/token_ledger.jsonl` — per-call entries, sortable by line

The same per-call entries are also in your own `logs/token_ledger.jsonl` (the parent's), tagged with `source: "daemon"` and `em_id`. Your lifetime token totals (what `sum_token_ledger` reports) include all daemon spend.

### "Why did it fail?"

Read `daemon.json`'s `error` field — `{type, message}`. For more depth, tail `logs/events.jsonl` for the `daemon_error` event and look at the preceding `tool_call`/`tool_result` entries to see what was happening just before the failure.

## Worked example: a daemon that's been running 5 minutes

You called `daemon(action="emanate", ...)` for `em-3`, asked it to "scan src/ for security issues", and it's been running 5 minutes. You're nervous.

```bash
# What's the live state?
read("daemons/em-3-20260427-094215-abc123/daemon.json")
# → state=running, turn=8, current_tool=null, tool_call_count=15, tokens.input=22000

# Last few lines of the transcript
bash("tail -n 20 daemons/em-3-20260427-094215-abc123/history/chat_history.jsonl")
# → assistant: "Found a potential SQL injection in db.py:42. Continuing..."

# Recent tool activity
bash("tail -n 10 daemons/em-3-20260427-094215-abc123/logs/events.jsonl")
# → series of read/grep events on src/db/, src/auth/
```

That's a healthy pattern: the LLM is between tool calls, has good progress narrative, and is steadily working through files. **Don't reclaim.** Let it cook.

## API note: `daemon(action="list")`

`list` reports only currently-active emanations (in-memory registry). It includes `run_id` and `path` so you know where to read on disk. Historical (completed/failed/cancelled) emanations don't appear in `list` — find them with `bash("ls daemons/")` instead.

## What the manual does NOT cover

- Provider routing / LLM presets — deferred to a separate spec.
- Cross-process recovery — if your kernel restarted mid-daemon, the folder may show `state=running` indefinitely. Compare `now()` vs `.heartbeat` mtime to detect orphans.
- Folder cleanup — there is none. Molts wipe the working dir. For non-molting agents, you may eventually want to `rm -rf daemons/em-*-2026-04-*` manually.
