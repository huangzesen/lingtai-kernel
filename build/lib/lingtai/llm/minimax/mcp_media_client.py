"""MiniMax Media MCP factory — builds MCPClient instances for the full minimax-mcp server.

Unlike ``mcp_client.py`` (which manages a singleton for the coding-plan server
with web_search + understand_image), this module creates *per-capability*
MCPClient instances backed by the full ``minimax-mcp`` package that provides
media-generation tools: text_to_audio, music_generation, text_to_image, etc.

Each capability (talk, compose, draw) can create its own client so that
different capabilities can point to different servers or configurations.
